Every staff welcomes you with a big smile. Food was good, property had many options to explore. The 9:30 pm shows were great!”<br>“The resort was wonderful and exceptionally clean. Staff was excellent and very helpful. Best part was that this resort lets you relax. Yes you do have to make dinner reservations but you don't have to dress up (like making men wear slacks!), you can be comfortable and cool. But since there are 3 Iberostar resorts all next to each other, they should let you visit all of them, just saying. The restaurants were wonderful and there was plenty of food at the buffet. Just another suggestion - maybe a couple of times a week, have a theme night in the buffet. It would be interesting.” </strong>
